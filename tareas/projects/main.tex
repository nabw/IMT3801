\maketitle
Course projects must be developed in groups of 1--3 people. Presentation dates can be flexible but will be preferrably taking place during the last week of lessons of the semester. 

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Heat equation analysis.} This equations consists in the following: Find $u$ in a Bochner space $L^2(0,T;H_{\Gamma_D}^1(\Omega))$ such that for a heat source $f$ such that $f(t)$ in $[H_{\Gamma_D}^1(\Omega)]'$ and an initial condition $u_0$ in $L^2(\Omega)$ it holds that
        $$ \parder{u}{t} - \Delta u = f \qquad\text{in $(0,T]\times \Omega$}. $$
        This project's goals are:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item To study the well-posedness theory of parabolic equations in a Bochner space setting.
            \item To study and analyze its spatial discretization with FEM.
            \item To study and analyze its time discretization using the $\theta$-method.
            \item To validate numerically the computed convergence rates.
        \end{itemize}

        \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{The Helmholtz problem.} This problem consists in finding the eigenvalues of the Laplace operator, i.e. a pair $(\omega, u)$ such that
        $$ -\Delta u = \omega u. $$
        For this project you will have to 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Study the well-posedness of the problem using Fredholm theory and G\r arding inequalities.
            \item Study the spectral properties of the Laplacian for Dirichlet, Neumann, and mixed boundary conditions.
            \item Study the spectral properties of the discretized Laplacian under Dirichlet, Neumann, and mixed boundary conditions.
            \item Study the convergence of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors and devise strategies to matche the discrete eigenvalues to the corresponding continuous ones.
            \item Validate numerically the convergence rates.
        \end{itemize}
        The following references will be useful for this project:

            \item Babuska, Osborne. Eigenvalue problems in \emph{Handbook of Numerical Analysis}. 1990.
        \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{The Darcy problem.} This is a mixed problem, given by: Find $u$ in $\vec H(\dive)$ and $p$ in $L^2(\Omega)$ such that for some $f$ in $L^2(\Omega)$ it holds that
        $$ \begin{aligned}
            u + \grad p &= 0 && \Omega \\
            \dive u     &= f && \Omega \\
            u\cdot \vec n &= 0 && \Gamma_D \\
            p           &= p_0 && \Gamma_N.
        \end{aligned} $$
        For this project you will have to 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Study how this problem is related to the Poisson problem, and when they are equivalent.
            \item Study the LBB theory and show that it applies to it
            \item Study the discrete problem and show that the LBB conditions hold
            \item Validate numerically the convergence rates
        \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{The steady Navier-Stokes equation.} The steady Navier-Stokes equation consists in finding a velocity field $\vec u$ in $H_D^1(\Omega, \R^d)$ and a pressulre $p$ in $L^2(\Omega)$ such that
            $$\begin{aligned}
                -\mu \Delta \vec u + [\grad \vec u] \vec u + \grad p &= \vec f && \Omega \\
                \dive \vec u &= 0 && \Omega \\
                \vec u = \vec u_D && \Gamma_D \\
                \ten \sigma(\vec u, p)\vec n &= \vec t && \Gamma_N, 
            \end{aligned}$$
            where $\vec f$ in $[H_d^1(\Omega, \R^d)]'$ is a given load, $\vec u_D$ in $H^{1/2}(\Gamma_D)$ is a Dirichlet boundary condition, $\ten\sigma(\vec u, p) = \mu\grad \vec u - p\ten I$ is the stress tensor, $\vec n$ is the normal vector, and $\vec t$ in $H^{-1/2}(\Gamma_N)$ is a given surface traction. The objective of this project is to investigate the techniques required to handle the nonlinearity of this problem in order to guarantee the existence (and possibly uniqueness) of solutions. This implies:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item To understand the saddle point structure of the problem
                \item To formulate an auxiliary linear problem that defines a fixed-point operator
                \item To establish conditions that guarantee contractiveness
                \item To study extensions using Schauder and Brower fixed-point theorems
                \item To use the fixed-point operator to devise a solution strategy of the nonlinear problem
                \item To use such techniques to establish the convergence of a FEM scheme
                \item To validate all theoretical claims numerically
            \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{The unsteady Navier-Stokes equation.} Adding a time derivative to the momentum equation in the previous equation yields the unsteady NS equation. The scope of this project is to study the numerical instabilities that this equation presents, and some of the remedies that can be used. In particular, provide stabilization strategies for
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Inf-sup instabilities
            \item Reynolds instabilities
            \item Turbulence modeling
        \end{itemize}
        All tests shall be performed on a standard flow pasta a cylinder test (in 2D) to obtain physically relevant solutions to be compared. 
    \item \textbf{The incompressible elasticity equation.} The incompressible elasticity equation is given by 
            $$\begin{aligned}
                -\dive\left( \ten P - \lambda J \ten F^{-T}\right) &= \vec f &&\Omega, \\
                J&= 1 &&\Omega,
            \end{aligned}$$
            plus boundary conditions. The idea of this project is to correctly employ a Lagrange multiplier procedure to derive this problem for hyperelastic materials, and then use homotopy continuation to study certain bifurcation phenomena present in nonlinear elasticity. For this: 
            \begin{itemize}
                \item To correctly derive the model
                \item To formulate a model with rotating boundary conditions (Dirichlet vs Neumann approaches)
                \item To devise a parameter to be used for the continuation 
                \item To push the model until bifurcation happens
                \item To study polyconvexity and use materials that satisfy such a condition (and not convexity)
                \item To revise (not in detail) bifurcation theory to justify the observations
                \item What can be said about approximation properties? 
            \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{The Keller-Segel equation.} Chemotaxis describes the dynamics of species that are on one hand attracted and on the other one repelled by certain species. This is described by the following system of equations: 
        $$\begin{aligned}
            \partial_t u &= \dive\left(D_1(u,c)\grad u - \chi(u,c) \grad c\right) && \Omega \\
            \partial_t c &= D_2\Delta c - g(c) c + f(c) u && \Omega \\
            [D_1(u,c)\grad u]\cdot \vec n = \grad c\cdot \vec n &= 0 && \partial \Omega,
        \end{aligned} $$
        with some initial conditions for $u,c$. The idea of this project is
        \begin{itemize}
            \item To propose a time discretization scheme for the model 
            \item To study the well-posedness of the time-discrete problem
            \item To establish the convergence of a FEM scheme for the semi-discrete problems
            \item To study the concept of Turing instabilities that give rise to pattern formation
            \item To simulate scenarios that are Turing stable and unstable. 
        \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{An optimal control problem.} An optimal control problem is a PDE-constrained optimization problem. The idea of this project is to study the discretization of a simple optimal control problem, given by the volume control of the Laplacian. This can be stated as the following minimization problem: 
        $$ \begin{aligned} \min_{u,\mu} && \frac 1 2 \|u - u_\Omega\|_0^2 &+ \alpha \|\mu\|_0^2 && \\
            \text{s.t.} && -\Delta u &= \mu &&  \Omega \\
                        && u &= 0 && \partial\Omega
        \end{aligned} $$
        This project consists in:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item To study the adjoint method
            \item Establishing the well-posedness of this problem using the Stampacchia theorem
            \item To formulate a FEM approximation of the problem using either optimize-then-discretize or discretize-then-optimize strategies
            \item Show that optimization and discretization in this setting \emph{do not commute}
            \item Show the convergence rates of the model
            \item To implement the problem and validate all theoretical claims numerically
        \end{itemize}

        For this problem, the following references will be useful: 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Tröltzsch, Optimal control of partial differential equations: theory, methods, and applications. 2010.
            \item Manzoni, Quarteroni, Salsa. Optimal control of partial differential equations. 2021.
        \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Wave equation.} The scope of this project is that of studying the wave equation, given by finding a function $u(t)$ in $H_0^1(\R^d)=\{v\in H^1(\R^d): \lim_{|x|\to \infty} v(x) = 0\}$  such that
        $$ c\parder{^2 u}{t^2} -\Delta u=0 $$
        for some initial condition. The scope of this project is to:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Study the formulation of symplectic time integration methods that guarantee energy conservation
            \item Study the formulation of boundary conditions that allow for a truncation of the domain (unbounded into a bounded one)
            \item Implement different symplectic time integrators and study the well-posedness of the semi-discrete problem
            \item Study the convergence of a FEM scheme for the semi-discrete problem and establish its convergence properties
            \item Validate all theoretical propositions numerically
        \end{itemize}

        \paragraph{\textbf{Flexibilities. }} All projects will be assumed to be developed in high level software such as Firedrake/NGSolve/FEniCS/etc, so that the implementation of a FEM code is not part of the difficulty. Still, flexilibity with respect to the stated goals will be considered for projects if you want to explore different topics, such as: 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Implementation in a lower-level library, such as \texttt{deal.ii} [C++], \texttt{PETSc} [C], Ferrite [Julia].
            \item Study of preconditioning strategies using spectrally equivalent operators.
            \item Study of parallel implementations.
            \item Study of iterative methods such as Uzawa schemes, or any infinite-dimensional optimization problem.
            \item Others you can think of.
        \end{itemize}

        \paragraph{\textbf{Inflexibilities.}} A final grade in the project below a 50\% means failing the entire course, and attendance to the final presentation is mandatory for all group members unless timely justified. Each projects can be taken by up to two groups. It will be fundamental for all projects to have 
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item A derivation of the model from fundamental principles
            \item Continuous and discrete analysis
            \item A convergence analysis showing that there is a controlable gap between the discrete solutions and the continuous ones
            \item Two simulations: a numerical validation of the computed convergence rates and a physically significant one
        \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
